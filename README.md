# unsupervised-learning


For our Machine Learning project, my team aimed to predict which teams will make the NBA playoffs and are likely to win the championship based on mid-season performances as well as advanced statistical models. View our website here: https://kimayamcolaco.github.io/CS7641-Team-25/

This is the unsupervised learning portion of our code where we made a model to predict the NBA teams that will make the playoffs vs the teams that will not make the playoffs using GMM.
